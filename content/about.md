# Hey, I'm Brandon
I am a senior backend engineer with over 8 years of experience building distributed systems. 

I created this site as a way to help in my own investigations and learnings, I realized that I am able to learn and retain information better if I take the time and start explaining, as if trying to teach it to someone else.

Outside of work my hobbies include hiking, running, playing guitar and video games.
