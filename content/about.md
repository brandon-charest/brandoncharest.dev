# Hey, I'm Brandon

I'm a senior backend engineer with over 8 years of experience building distributed systems that scale. Throughout my career, I've worked on challenging problems involving high-throughput architectures, data pipelines, and infrastructure that powers modern applications.

## Why This Site Exists

I created this space as way to document my journey and help me gain a deeper understanding of the technologies I use. I've found that the best way to truly learn something is to explain it to others—there's, writing forces me to confront gaps in my knowledge and refine my thinking. What starts as personal notes becomes a learning artifact that might help someone else down the road or even myself again for when I inevitably forget something...

This is my digital garden: a place where ideas are planted, cultivated, and sometimes pruned as my understanding evolves.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not writing code, you'll find me:
- **On the trails** — I'm a big fan of running and hiking,, its a great way to be up and moving. I can thank Covid for helping me find this one.
- **Making noise** — Playing guitar. I have been playing guitar for ~13 years(?). I forget exactly how long it has been. 
- **Gaming** — Tackling my ever-growing backlog of video games.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat software engineering & technologies, share trail recommendations, or debate which games deserve to be in the top 10 greatest games of all time.
