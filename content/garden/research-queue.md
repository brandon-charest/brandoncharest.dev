A running list of topics of interest I want to explore further when I get the time...

## 📥 Incoming Research

- [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/): Want to understand how to attach probes to the kernel.
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/): Seems like an interesting take on C. Find use cases, and maybe a small side project. Maybe I can re-implement my virtual memory manager from C.
- [Firecracker microVMs](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/): Used under the hood for AWS Lambda and Fargate, should learn more about exactly how it works.
- [etcd](https://etcd.io/): Why is everyone talking about this.
- [Zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd): fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting real-time compression.


## Future Project Ideas
- 6502 Chip Emulator
- HTTP from the ground up
- Toy Kernel
