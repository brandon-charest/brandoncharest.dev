Its one of my favorite times of the year, time for a new AoC.

Every December, I participate in **Advent of Code**—a series of Christmas-themed logic puzzles that get progressively harder to solve.

## The Objective
I use this as an excuse to **learn a new programming language** every year. It is less about finishing all the days and more about seeing how far I can get. This year for **2025** I will be focusing on trying out **Rust**. Last year I tried a functional language **Elixir** and failed spectacularly.

## System Logs
Below are my solutions, although I try and clean-up my code at the end, expect pretty messy and questionable coding decisions 😄
